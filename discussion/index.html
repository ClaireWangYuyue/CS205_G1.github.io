	<h1> Future Work </h1>
	<p> One possible direction is to implement a shared stack for the OpenMP version, which stores 
		all the intermediate states. We can initialize the stack with the original board. Each 
		thread pops an intermediate board from the stack each time, and pushes the board back 
		with one more cell filled. Invalid solutions will be discarded, and solutions will be
		recorded in a queue and output in the end.
	</br></br>
             Another possibility is to apply a better solving algorithm. The solver we implemented is a
                brute force solver using backtracking algorihm. It guarantees to find all solutions if
                they exist but is very slow. With a humanistic solver or constraint propagation alogrithm, 
                the execution time may be reduced.

		Our project is inspired by a problem in AM225. The queue scheme for parallelism is learned 
		from the files on the following website: 
		https://github.com/chr1shr/am225_solutions/tree/master/hw1/problem4, but our structure and 
		algorithm of the Sudoku solver are different.
