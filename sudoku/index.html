					<p>
					Sudoku is a combinatorial number placement puzzle.\n
						
					The objective of this game is to fill a 9×9 grid (board) with digits so that each column, 
					each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids (boxes) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. \n

			<p>
			Higher-rank sudokus usually have n<sup>2</sup>×n<sup>2</sup> board with n×n boxes (n>3). (e.g. 16*16, 25*25, 100*100) \n
			
			However, high-rank problems with a large number of empty cells can take hours or even days to solve. 
				Execution time will increase drastically with n.\n
						
			Thus, we aim to parallelize a sudoku solver algorithm with several parallelization techniques (OpenMP and MPI), 
						so that giant sudoku solver can be solved within a limited time.\n
