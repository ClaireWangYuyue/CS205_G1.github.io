	<h1 style="font-family:Raleway; color:#00343f;">Data Description</h1>
	<p> We found three 16x16 and three 25x25 Sudoku puzzles with different difficulty levels 
		to test our software and compute speedup. All the problems were found online. We
		manually took out a few cells from the solution board to adjust problem difficulty.</p>

				<li>Backtracking Algorithm </li>

							correct values until it reaches a solution.</li>

				<xmp>
At the i-th empty cell on the board:
	for all possible fill-ins:
		fill the number
		if this is the last empty cell:
			return the solution
		else:
			search the (i+1)-th empty cell
	return with no solution

			<ul >
			  <li>Serially generate a list of incomplete solutions through bootstrapping:
				fill a few empty cells with all possible values, and generate a shared queue of
				possible board to be solved by each thread</li>
			  <li>Each thread solve the boards in parallel with the backtracking algorithm</li>
			  <li>Use dynamic scheduling to balance work load on all threads: each thread
				will pop a new board from the queue to solve when it finished solving the previous board</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
			  <li>Serially generate a list of incomplete solutions </li>
			  <li>Evenly dispatch the list of borads to nodes</li>
				<ul >
					<li>Each node generates a list of incomplete solutions using 
						the same method as the OpenMP version</li>
					<li>Each node performs OMP-level parallelism to solve the puzzle</li>
				</ul>
			  <li>All nodes output the solutions to a queue of solutions to be gathered and 
				  printed out by the master node </li>

	        <p class="subtitle" style="color:#00343f;">Advanced Feature</p>
	                <ul>
				<li>MPI Random Shuffling: The queue of boards is shuffled before dispatching to each
					node. This will make sure that the work load of each node is relatively
					balanced, and no node waits a long time for the other nodes to finish.</li>
				<li>MPI Dynamic Scheduling: The master node and the slave nodes keep iterating 
					throughout the process. During each iteration, they perform different jobs. 
					The master node will constantly query the status of the slave nodes and assign
					work to the idle ones. A slave node will work on the jobs it is assigned, and report 
					whether or not it has finished all the previously assigned jobs to the master 
					node when it is being queried. It will receive new tasks if it is idle. 
					Once the master node has assigned the last piece of work, it will broadcast a 
					stopping message and wait till all slaves stop. Non-blocking MPI communication 
					functionalities are applied to implement this feature.
